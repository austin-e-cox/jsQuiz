# jsQuiz
simple quiz for javascript questions

## Functionality
The page starts with a button to start the quiz.
Once clicked, a modal appears showing the top score if it exists.
Then if the user clicks start, the quiz begins, the user clicks through the answers, and gets a score at the end.
The local high score is updated if it is higher than the previous one.
You may click the hiscores in the to-left to see the list of highscores. If there are more than 10 highscores, the program determines the top 10 scores and truncates others appropriately.
